This Unreal Engine project is the creation of a plugin that enabled multiplayer functionality for any Unreal Engine game.
Simply click Host and you can Host a level of your choosing on a listen server.

Obviously, you will need to add multiplayer code to your game, but this at least gets the listen server setup for you and a proper
network connection to your players established.
