This Unreal Engine project is the creation of a plugin that enabled multiplayer functionality for any Unreal Engine game.
Simply click Host and you can Host a level of your choosing on a listen server.

Obviously, you will need to add multiplayer code to your game, but this at least gets the listen server setup for you and a proper
network connection to your players established.

If you'd like to utilize this plugin, simply download this repo as a zip. Then all you need to do is copy the Plugins folder over to another Unreal Engine project. Keep in mind that this was made specifically for Unreal Engine 5.3, but I believe it is also compatible with UE 5.2.
